# Python - Hello, World

This is the first Python project in the Holberton School curriculum.  
It introduces basic Python scripting, string operations, formatting techniques, and coding standards using `pycodestyle`.

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Use the Python interpreter to run scripts
- Print both strings and variables using `print()`
- Understand and apply string indexing and slicing
- Follow the official Python style guide (PEP8) using `pycodestyle`
- Work with executable script files in a Linux environment

---

## 🧰 Project Requirements

- Python 3.8.x
- All scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Files must be executable (use `chmod +x filename.py`)
- All code must follow `pycodestyle` version 2.7.*
- File lengths must comply with specified limits (check using `wc`)

| `6-concat.py`       | Concatenates two variables (`str1`, `str2`) to form a greeting              | `Welcome to Holberton School!` |
| `7-edges.py`        | Uses slicing to extract and print parts of a string                         | `First 3 letters: Hol`<br>`Last 2 letters: on`<br>`Middle word: olberto` |
| `8-concat_edges.py` | Combines specific slices of a string to construct a new sentence            | `object-oriented programming with Python` |
| `9-easter_egg.py`   | Prints “The Zen of Python” using Python's hidden `this` module              | (Full Zen of Python principles output) |

## 🔍 Style Guide

All scripts follow PEP8 and were verified using:

```bash
pycodestyle <filename.py>
```

---

## 🧪 How to Run Scripts

```bash
chmod +x <filename>.py
./<filename>.py
```
